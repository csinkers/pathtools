Heavy: Lots of protection, assault towns, fight animals.
Light: High damage. Weak against ranged groups & animals.
Martial: Like light, but only better at high levels (90+)
Ranged: Good to dual w/ martial (swap hat) or even add stealth


Crab Armour good against animals.
Chain is bad, only good shirts are LTurtle + DarkL. DarkL better w/ robo limbs.


Katanas: Nodachi good
Sabre: Desert high dam, esp vs spiders. Foreign Sabre v good defense. Longsword good balance.
